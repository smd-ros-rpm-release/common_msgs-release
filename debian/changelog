ros-hydro-geometry-msgs (1.8.8-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * removed obsolete catkin tag from manifest files
  * removed unnecessary package name from some messages
  * adding manifest exports
  * removed depend, added catkin
  * stripping depend and export tags from common_msgs manifests as msg dependencies are now declared in cmake and stack.yaml.  Also removed bag migration exports
  * install-related fixes
  * common_msgs: removing migration rules as all are over a year old
  * bye bye vestigial MSG_DIRS
  * geometry_msgs: getting rid of other build files
  * updated to new catkin_export_python macro
  * adios rosbuild2 in manifest.xml
  * catkin updates
  * catkin_project
  * Updated to work with new message generation macros
  * adios debian/ hello stack.yaml.  (sketch/prototype/testing).
  * Getting standalone message generation working... w/o munging rosbuild2
  * rosbuild2 tweaks
  * initial updating for new light message generation and wgbuild
  * missing dependencies
  * updating bagmigration exports
  * rosbuild2 taking shape
  * workaround bug #ros3018 until ros-1.2.3 comes out
  * removing all the extra exports
  * Added Ubuntu platform tags to manifest
  * Remove use of deprecated rosbuild macros
  * link to tf package as per doc review
  * doc reviewed status
  * wrapping manifest nicely
  * updated url and description
  * full migration rules
  * switching TransformStamped logic to follow that of all other frame_ids where the frame_id is the operating frame and there is now a child_frame_id which defines the target frame.  And the parent frame is gone.  This is only changing the message.  The API change will come later.
  * making covariance follow same convention as Pose
  * rotation representation was specified the wrong way in the message comment
  * Adding a stamped version of polygon
  * Adding comment to Polygon message
  * Adding migration rule from ParticleCloud to PoseArray
  * clearing API reviews for they've been through a bunch of them recently.
  * comments on all msgs except Polygon
  * removing PoseWithRates as it's deprecated.
  * Changing naming of bag migration rules.
  * Modifying migration rules for Odometry and WrenchStamped change of field names.
  * Adding actual migration rules for all of the tested common_msgs migrations.
  * undo of #2270 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2270>, (.data for stamped). reverts r21133
  * Adding migration rules to get migration tests to pass.
  * switching from PosewithRatesStamped to Odometry #2277 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2277>
  * Fixing some of the migration rules associated with unrolling of the .data change.
  * PoseWithCovarianceStamped::data -> PoseWithCovarianceStamped::pose
  * Reverse r21134, PointStamped::point->PointStamped::data
  * reverse QuaternionStamped::quaternion -> QuaternionStamped::data change
  * undoing r21137, keeping Vector3Stamped as was, but keeping in fix to door_handle_detector 'using' bug
  * Adding more migration rule tests and fixing assorted rules.
  * reverting r2118. Redoing #2275 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2275> #2274 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2274> to not go to 'data' standard
  * #2271 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2271> Vector3Stamped uses new standarization
  * PointStamped::point -> PointStamped::data (#2276 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2276>)
  * new Stamped format #2270 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2270>
  * Changing migration rule for Twist to go to TwistStamped.
  * QuaternionStamped::quaternion -> QuaternionStamped::data (#2278 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2278>)
  * #2274 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2274> #2275 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2275> updated to header/data
  * PoseWithCovariance->PoseWithCovarianceStamped
    PoseWithCovarianceStamped::pose_with_covariance -> PoseWithCovarianceStamped::data
  * First half of the change from deprecated_msgs::RobotBase2DOdom to nav_msgs::Odometry, I think all the c++ compiles, can't speak for functionality yet, also... the python has yet to be run... this may break some things
  * Moved robot_msgs/Polygon3D to geometry_msgs/Polygon for ticket #1310 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/1310>
  * moving PoseArray into geometry_msgs #1907 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/1907>
  * removing header for this is a type for composing and doesn't stand on it's own to be transformed etc.
  * adding TwistWithCovariance #2251 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2251>
  * creating Wrench and WrenchStamped in geometry_msgs #1935 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/1935>
  * adding unused Pose2D message as per API review #2249 <https://github.com/ros/common_msgs/issues/2249>
  * geometry_msgs: Documented that covariance uses fixed axis not euler angles.
  * merging in the changes to messages see ros-users email.  THis is about half the common_msgs API changes
